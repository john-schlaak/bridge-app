        #   a tree with many nodes each with a distinct ID, some may have identical bids (but different meanings);
        #   a list of edges going from each node to other nodes, I.e rules, and multiple rules can point to the same node, but rules are never circular; the tree traverses downward, though nodes can be skipped and there can be multiple nodes (with different id's) at the same bid level.  there are 35 bids so the max depth of the tree is 35 but thats somewhat unlikely.  basically ignore this for now, and I'm not sure why you scrolled all the way over here, who writes obnoxiously long comments like this?
